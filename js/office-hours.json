Where have you seen this in the curriculum?<br> @Andrew: hey @Andrew W it came up in a project i’m working on outside the curriculum and i thought this would be a good place to ask. no worries if it’s outside of the scope of the program<br> @david: Hey @Andrew - It sounds like what you're talking about is the idea of inheritance - where you have a new class that is a superset of a base class. <br>That's a pretty common practice in most OOP languages. It works a _little_ differently under the hood in JS, because of the Object-first nature of the language, but overall it's generally the same idea.<br> @Andrew: thanks @David i’ll take a look at inheritance again",

I've a click `eventListener` and when I click on a tile an ID I have assigned to the `li` element is pushed to the array. However if I click a card that is opened or double click this will be assigned as the second value and compared and obviously it is the same card so it will return true and the card will stay open. I've tried comparing the element but I'm struggling with ideas to identify this particular element since it will be identical to the one that it matches and every form I think of would prevent the match. I think I'm a bit burned out with this memory game now. Are there any ideas or places you could suggest that I could look into? Thank you.",
