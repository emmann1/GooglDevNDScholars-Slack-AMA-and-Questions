After a student provides a rating, they’ll be able to continue corresponding with their mentor.<br>If a student would like to be reassigned to a new mentor,  they’re able to do so when they provide a weekly rating for their mentor.

I can say this though: I would recommend you not even give the _option_ for an interviewer to ask about for more info about your Nanodegrees—show off your work!!! One of the fantastic things about FEND is that you finish with a portfolio.

It's been a while since I finished FEND (almost 2 years now), but I think a lot of the later projects are able to be personalized and modified. Side projects definitely help as well.

There's a certain point where 'you just get it.' It's that 'AHA' moment, where you know how to fish and your growth trajectory/slope is high.

You'll learn a lot more and be able to _do_ a lot more.

I think FE is a really good entrypoint or launchpad into other parts of the stack (going into back-end as well), but can also branch laterally into other disciplines like design.

It's an important interview skill, but also an important programming skill—DS and algos are the primitives of how we build software... things (data) and how to manipulate things (algos). That said, I don't claim that the interview process is perfect. Solving puzzles isn't a good proxy for showing the ability to build a website.
