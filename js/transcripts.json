As a Nanodegree program graduate, you will retain access to your programs materials for a period of time after graduation, and you may download certain materials for your own records if you wish.

First phase is 'just a course' while second phase, the actual scholarship program, starts most likely on the day this here ends (8th of May + three month + one week selection=15th of august).",

This means you can take advantage of some of the Career Services that are offered to graduates– some services include events, webinars, etc. Second, you will have a bunch of new skills and knowledge that you can leverage.

This course – and this profession – is all about strict time management and meeting deadlines on time.<br>Magda: as long as the submitted project is correct, it will be deemed as passed. The deadlines are there to help you pace your learning experience, but the only hard stop is the final deadline on August 15.
